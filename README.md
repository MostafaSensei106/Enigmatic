## About

Enigmatic is a encryption and decryption tool that simulates the functionality of the historic Enigma machine. It allows you to encrypt, decrypt, and analyze text using customizable encryption settings, while also providing detailed text analysis and encryption logs.

## Features

üåü Here are some of the standout features of this Script:

1. **Encryption & Decryption**:
    - Encrypt and decrypt text using a configurable Enigma machine with rotors, reflectors, and plugboards.

2. **Text Analysis**:
    - Perform detailed analysis of text, including frequency distribution, entropy, and n-gram analysis.

3. **User Interface**:
    - Interactive and colorful terminal-based interface using Rich for styling and Figlet for banner generation.

4. **ARB File Generation**:
    - Generates ARB files for both source and translated strings.

5. **Logging**:
    - Detailed logging of activities, errors, and encryption sessions for debugging and auditing.

6. **Random Key Generation**:
    - Automatically generates random encryption keys for enhanced security.

8. **NLTK Integration**:
    - Text analysis utilizing the NLTK library for word frequencies and entropy calculations.

## Installation

Get Enigmatic up and running on your local machine in just a few steps:

1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     https://github.com/MostafaSensei106/Enigmatic.git
     ```
3. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd Enigmatic
    ```
4. Install srcipt requirements:
    ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
5. Run the script:
     ```bash
     python enigmatic.py
     ```

## How to Use

After running the script, you can use the following commands in the terminal:

 - `encrypt <text> --key <json file>` : Encrypt the given text using the provided key in JSON format.

 - `decrypt <text> --key <json file>` : Decrypt the given text using the provided key in JSON format.

 - `analyze <text>` : Analyze the frequency and entropy of the given text or text file.
 
 - `exit` or `q`: Exit the program.

 - `help` : Display available commands and their usage.
